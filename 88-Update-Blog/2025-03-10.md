<h2>End of the line</h2>
<p>Whilst I've managed to get started on the code, the reality is I'm spending more time dealing with hardware than development. On their own, each of these problems are small, but when put together, they make the system unreliable. As such, I'm heading back to the drawing board to re-work the project.</p>
<p>The following are some, but not all of the issues.</p>
<p>My original idea was to mount the MCU/Controller onto the rear hatch, that way the hatch can be opened for easy access. In reality this is problematic at best. I can get it to shut, but everything moves and things can come unplugged.</p>

<p>Where to place the Grove Vision AI V2 has been another problem. As it's small, I though I would just find somewhere to put it. Unfortunatly the ribbon cable affects it's manoverability and placement. Additionally, powering the vision system has been problematic. Given its current placement, I can't easily check if the power light is on. Finally, when the rear hatch closes, the nodeMCU hits the XIAO Board.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The wires are an absolute spagetti party. Any of these could come unplugged when opening/closing the rear door. They could also fatigue, leading to broken cable wires that can't be seen.</p>

<p>This cable for the IR sensors likes to pull out whenever I open the rear hatch. Yes I could use a longer cable, but that will just lead to more spagehtti.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I over-tightened one of the mount screws, possibly damaging this trace.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A minor misalignment at the base of the neck has led to a large misalignment at the top. I'm concidering some sort of adjustment system in the future.</p>

<p>Lastly, the onshape project is a real mess; I have created a heap of circular references. Even simply making the robot slightly longer will break the project. Feel free to have a gander <a href="https://cad.onshape.com/documents/f86bc7a8d7af23b6e95ca6b1/w/f876fdbf36e87988d1a9e18b/e/13ebae6ad3caa0eb0b2c2352?renderMode=0&amp;uiState=67ceb29cf769e81b46219bc9">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>I'm still feeling very positive about the project. Rework is just part of the process. Im going to re-design this from the gound up, details of which will come in a future post.</p>
