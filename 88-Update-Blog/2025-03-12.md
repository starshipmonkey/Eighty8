<h2>One Last Crack</h2>
<p>In my last post I artiulated a range of issues with my design, so I wont go over them again in detail. In short, there was too much movement in all the cables, leading to reliability issues.</p>
<p>After detailing the issues, I had a though. What if I moved the MCU/Controller to the main chassis. I spent the following evening rewiring everything. Below is a much cleaner wiring setup that should eliminate a good number of the issues.</p>
<p>Of course this doesn't resolve all the issues, but I am hoping it will allow me to realise the projects initial goals.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The micro-USB used on the ESP is a weak link. It is also now obscured from access. By adding in the shortest USB cable I had, I can minimise stress on the plug. I am now using a USB A extension cable to plug/unplug Eighty8. As I am using ESPNOW to communicate with the Xiao/Vision AI V2, wireless programming is not an option (or at least can't be implemented without significant hassles).</p>
