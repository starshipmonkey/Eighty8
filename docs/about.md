# About the Eighty8 Robotics Project

## Our Mission

The Eighty8 project aims to develop innovative robotics solutions that bridge the gap between advanced technology and practical applications. We believe in creating robots that are accessible, functional, and can integrate seamlessly into everyday environments to solve real-world problems.

## Project Goals

- Develop open-source robotics platforms that encourage collaboration and innovation
- Create modular designs that allow for customization and adaptation to different use cases
- Prioritize user-friendly interfaces that make robotics technology accessible to non-experts
- Build a community of developers, engineers, and enthusiasts around our platform
- Document our journey thoroughly to help others learn and contribute

## Our History
